Managing a Cognitive Services Account with Private Endpoint

This project focuses on managing a Cognitive Services account with a private endpoint. Cognitive Services offer a range of AI-powered APIs and services for various tasks such as vision, speech, language, and decision-making. By utilizing a private endpoint, the project enhances security by restricting network access to the services, ensuring that data stays within a private network and reducing exposure to potential threats. This README provides guidance on setting up and managing the Cognitive Services account with a private endpoint, enhancing data privacy and security for AI-driven applications.
